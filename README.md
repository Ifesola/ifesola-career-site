# Ifesola Fadare – Web Portfolio

This repository contains my personal web portfolio for the **Web Development Foundations course at Western Governors University.  
The site showcases my **résumé**, **cover letter**, and **career goals** using semantic HTML5, modern CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript for interactivity.
